# Mbhv IP Protect

Mbhv IP Protect is a plugin designed to prevent players from logging in with different accounts on your Minecraft server. It is particularly useful for cracked Minecraft servers where account protection is crucial.

## Overview

This plugin ensures that players cannot log in using accounts that are different from the ones they initially logged in with. For example, if a player named Alex joins the server and then logs out, another player named Steve cannot join the server using Alex's account. Any attempts to do so are blocked by the plugin and logged in the server's log file.
